# Hi! I am Ejar

<!--
**ejarkm/ejarkm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a Data Scientist, statistitian and a innovation geek, I currently work with NLP, Computer vision, tabular data and learning about digital signals. My goal is to be able to use the data of any electronic device (I am still in the process of it ðŸ˜„)

Currently most of my repositories are on private but that would change in the future.

Blog website, currently under development.
